# Dynamic replication in data grid
This program is the simulation process of the paper entitled "A Dynamic Replication Mechanism in Data Grid Based on a Weighted Priority-based Scheme" published by i-manager's Journal on Cloud Computing in August 2019.
<br/>
<br/>
## Elements
The program includes three algorithms: LRU, LFU and WPRS.
<br/>
<br/>
LRU is the least recently used algorithm, LFU is the least frequently used algorithm, and WPRS is the weighted priority-based replication scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language
The program is developed in MATLAB.
